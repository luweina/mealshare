# Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code compiles. Run `make` before creating the pull request.
2. If you're adding new external API, it must be properly documented.
3. The commit message is formatted as follows:


   component: <summary>

   A paragraph explaining the problem and its context.

   Another one explaining how you solved that.

   <link to the bug ticket>
```

4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of the maintainers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

# Code of Conduct

Home Chef To Do is a project developed based on Home Chef Code of Conduct. You can read it below:



## Advice

 * **Be respectful and considerate**: Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour or personal
     attacks. Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one.

 * **Be patient and generous**: If someone asks for help it is because they need it. Do politely
     suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where appropriate, but avoid
     aggressive or vague responses such as "RTFM".

 * **Assume people mean well**: Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between
     competing priorities. If you disagree, please do so politely. If something seems outrageous,
     check that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for clarification, but do not assume the worst.

 * **Try to be concise**: Avoid repeating what has been said already. Making a conversation larger
     makes it difficult to follow, and people often feel personally attacked if they receive multiple
     messages telling them the same thing.


In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.
