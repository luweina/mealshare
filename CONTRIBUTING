# Contributing to Observe

## What should I know before I get started?

Make sure you've read the README file in this repo.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, a spelling mistake, or anything you don't like, submit an issue.

### Suggesting Enhancements or Optimizations

If you think you have a better way of doing something, submit an issue.

### Sudgesting new Features

If you would like to add a completely new feature to Observe, submit an issue.

### Your First Code Contribution

#### Forking

To make any code contributions, you'll have to fork this repo and keep your version synced with this repo. Read [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you need some help getting started.

#### Branching

We are using *[A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)* so make sure you always sync your repo from the `develop` branch and when you're done, pull request back into the `develop` branch. This makes it easier to organize code, update changelogs, and add tags and version numbers.

When you want to start coding, create a new `feature` branch off of the `develop` branch. You should name this banch `feature/name-of-feature`.

#### Writing Code

Before writing any code or making any commits, make sure to check out the [Styleguides](styleguides) section of this document.

Use TDD and make sure that all code has test coverage. 

Copy the style of code used in project. That goes for writing tests and production code. I should not be able to test your code apart from mine or anyone else's.

#### Pull Requests

Once you have completed you're code. Pull request your code into the `develop` branch of this repo.

## Styleguides

### Git Styleguide

Use [the seven rules of a great git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) when committing.

### Swift Styleguide

Refer to this [swift styleguide](https://github.com/meech-ward/swift-style-guide) for how you should write your swift code.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to sam@meech-ward.me.

# Issues, issues and more issues!

There are many ways you can contribute to Home Chef, and all of them involve creating issues
in [Home Chef issue tracker](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Home Chef/HomeChef-todo/issues). This is the
entry point for your contribution.

To create an effective and high quality ticket, try to put the following information on your
ticket:

     - For issues, please add the necessary steps to reproduce the issue.
     - For feature requests, add a detailed description of your proposal.
 2. A checklist of Development tasks
 3. A checklist of Design tasks
 4. A checklist of QA tasks

## Issue template
```
[Title of the issue or feature request]

Detailed description of the issue. Put as much information as you can, potentially
with images showing the issue or mockups of the proposed feature.

# Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code compiles. Run `make` before creating the pull request.
2. If you're adding new external API, it must be properly documented.
3. The commit message is formatted as follows:

```
   component: <summary>

   A paragraph explaining the problem and its context.

   Another one explaining how you solved that.

   <link to the bug ticket>
```

4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of the maintainers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

# Code of Conduct

Home Chef To Do is a project developed based on Home Chef Code of Conduct. You can read it below:



## Advice

 * **Be respectful and considerate**: Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour or personal
     attacks. Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one.

 * **Be patient and generous**: If someone asks for help it is because they need it. Do politely
     suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where appropriate, but avoid
     aggressive or vague responses such as "RTFM".

 * **Assume people mean well**: Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between
     competing priorities. If you disagree, please do so politely. If something seems outrageous,
     check that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for clarification, but do not assume the worst.

 * **Try to be concise**: Avoid repeating what has been said already. Making a conversation larger
     makes it difficult to follow, and people often feel personally attacked if they receive multiple
     messages telling them the same thing.


In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.
